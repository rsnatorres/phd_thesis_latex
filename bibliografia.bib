	abstract = {The role of conventions in Keynes’s theory has been controversial. When dealing with investment and production decisions, Keynes referred to a projective rule that is his main example of convention. In addition, conventions appear in the practical techniques that Keynes attributed to agents concerned with the accumulation of wealth. Two important points have been neglected in existing interpretations. First, all these practical rules are directly present in goods markets and are not just rules used in financial markets that possibly influence agents in goods markets. Second, Keynes’s conventions in investment decisions are characterized by two properties: conformity with conformity and arbitrariness. The mechanisms underlying conformity with conformity include informational differences and possibly epistemic legitimacy, but, in contrast to Keynes’s discussion of financial markets, not a coordination effect with self-fulfilling prophecies. Those two properties are not clear in the case of production decisions.},

	abstract = {The narrative approach to macroeconomic identification uses qualitative sources, such as newspapers or government records, to provide information that can help establish causal relationships. This paper discusses the requirements for rigorous narrative analysis using fresh research on the impact of monetary policy as the focal application. We read the historical minutes and transcripts of Federal Reserve policymaking meetings to identify significant contractionary and expansionary changes in monetary policy not taken in response to current or prospective developments in real activity for the period 1946 to 2016. We find that such monetary shocks have large and significant effects on unemployment, output, and inflation in the expected directions. Analysis of available policy records suggests that a contractionary monetary shock likely occurred in 2022. Based on the empirical estimates of the effect of previous shocks, one would expect substantial negative impacts on real GDP and inflation in 2023 and 2024.},

These real-world developments have spawned a huge new scholarly literature on central bank communication—mostly empirical, and almost all of it written in this decade. We survey this ever-growing literature. The evidence suggests that communication can be an important and powerful part of the central bank's toolkit since it has the ability to move financial markets, to enhance the predictability of monetary policy decisions, and potentially to help achieve central banks' macroeconomic objectives. However, the large variation in communication strategies across central banks suggests that a consensus has yet to emerge on what constitutes an optimal communication strategy.},

Our approach entails directly estimating the central bank's objective function from the sentiment expressed by policymakers in their internal meetings. We apply the approach to the objective function of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The results challenge two key aspects of conventional wisdom regarding FOMC preferences. First, the FOMC had an implicit inflation target of approximately 1½ percent on average over our baseline 2000 - 2011 sample period, significantly below the commonly-assumed value of 2. Second, the FOMC's loss depends strongly on output growth and stock market performance and less so on their perception of current economic slack.},

This allows us to construct a time-series of the informational content of COPOM statements, which we then use in regressions to explain changes in the term-structure of interest rates around COPOM meetings - together with a market-based measure of interest-rate surprises. We find that, during Governor Tombini's tenure, interest-rate surprises started to be "passed through" one-to-one (or more) even at long maturities, as markets seem to have bought into the idea that the interest-rate cuts that began in mid-2011 would lead to lower yields in Brazil into the foreseeable future. Most importantly, changes in the informational content of COPOM statements seem to have meaningful effects on yields at short-to-medium maturities. However, this result only holds for the period prior to Tombini's tenure.},

We also find that BCB words create more “noise”, since they generate an increased volatility of futures rates. Our analysis also reveals that monetary policy communication has increased its effectiveness – measured by its larger impact on future rates and a reduced volatility- after the 2008 international crisis. At the same time, the deeds became less relevant as the effect of the changes in the SELIC rate on future rates has declined since then.},

              Microblogging forums (e.g., Twitter) have become a vibrant online platform for exchanging stock‐related information. Using methods from computational linguistics, we analyse roughly 250,000 stock‐related messages (so‐called tweets) on a daily basis. We find an association between tweet sentiment and stock returns, message volume and trading volume, as well as disagreement and volatility. In contrast to previous related research, we also analyse the mechanism leading to an efficient aggregation of information in microblogging forums. Our results demonstrate that users providing above average investment advice are retweeted (i.e., quoted) more often and have more followers, which amplifies their share of voice.},

Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we first construct and empirically validate a gold-standard list of lexical features (along with their associated sentiment intensity measures) which are specifically attuned to sentiment in microblog-like contexts. We then combine these lexical features with consideration for five general rules that embody grammatical and syntactical conventions for expressing and emphasizing sentiment intensity. Interestingly, using our parsimonious rule-based model to assess the sentiment of tweets, we find that VADER outperforms individual human raters (F1 Classification Accuracy = 0.96 and 0.84, respectively), and generalizes more favorably across contexts than any of our benchmarks.},

análise de sentimentos em publicações de páginas públicas do Facebook.
Para isso, utiliza a Application programming interface (API) fornecida pelo
Facebook para recolha e carregamento de dados. Após o pré processamento de
dados, onde é efetuada a limpeza dos mesmos, utiliza um modelo de aprendizagem
supervisionado, desenvolvido e avaliado de acordo com os objetivos do projeto. Este
modelo é depois integrado na ferramenta desenvolvida. Esta ferramenta funciona
como uma aplicação web, onde é possível a qualquer utilizador, com uma conta no
Facebook e privilégios de administração de alguma página, visualizar graficamente
e por ordem cronológica o volume de interações que a sua página tem. Para
cada publicação, são ainda disponibilizados detalhes como número de partilhas,
interações (emojis), comentários, e para cada comentário, a sua classificação, positiva
ou negativa.
Espera-se que com esta ferramenta, os responsáveis pela gestão de páginas do
Facebook possam criar melhores conteúdos que permitam às organizações crescer
de forma saudável e sustentável. Especificamente no caso do Município de Pombal,
espera-se que a sua utilização permita à câmara estar mais perto dos seus munícipes
e compreender as diferentes opiniões e sentimentos em relação à administração do
município, assim como apoiar a tomada de decisões.},

	abstract = {This study analyzes online news disseminated throughout the pre-, during-, and post-intervention periods of the “Syphilis No!” Project, which was developed in Brazil between November 2018 and March 2019. We investigated the influence of sentiment aspects of news to explore their possible relationships with syphilis testing data in response to the syphilis epidemic in Brazil. A dictionary-based technique (VADER) was chosen to perform sentiment analysis considering the Brazilian Portuguese language. Finally, the data collected were used in statistical tests to obtain other indicators, such as correlation and distribution analysis. Of the 627 news items, 198 (31.58\%) were classified as a sentiment of security (TP2; stands for the news type 2), whereas 429 (68.42\%) were classified as sentiments that instilled vulnerability (TP3; stands for the news type 3). The correlation between the number of syphilis tests and the number of news types TP2 and TP3 was verified from (i) 2015 to 2017 and (ii) 2018 to 2019. For the TP2 type news, in all periods, the p-values were greater than 0.05, thus generating inconclusive results. From 2015 to 2017, there was an ρ = 0.33 correlation between TP3 news and testing data (p-value = 0.04); the years 2018 and 2019 presented a ρ = 0.67 correlation between TP3 news and the number of syphilis tests performed per month, with p-value = 0.0003. In addition, Granger’s test was performed between TP3 news and syphilis testing, which resulted in a p-value = 0.002, thus indicating the existence of Granger causality between these time series. By applying natural language processing to sentiment and informational content analysis of public health campaigns, it was found that the most substantial increase in testing was strongly related to attitude-inducing content (TP3).},

            This study aims to present an approach for the challenges of working with Sentiment Analysis (SA) applied to news articles in a multilingual corpus. It looks at the use and combination of multiple algorithms to explore news articles published in English and Portuguese. It presents a methodology that starts by evaluating and combining four SA algorithms (SenticNet, SentiStrength, Vader and BERT, being BERT trained in two datasets) to improve the quality of outputs. A thorough review of the algorithms’ limitations is conducted using SHAP, an explainable AI tool, resulting in a list of issues that researchers must consider before using SA to interpret texts. We propose a combination of the three best classifiers (Vader, Amazon BERT and Sent140 BERT) to identify contradictory results, improving the quality of the positive, neutral and negative labels assigned to the texts. Challenges with translation are addressed, indicating possible solutions for non-English corpora. As a case study, the method is applied to the study of the media coverage of London 2012 and Rio 2016 Olympic legacies. The combination of different classifiers has proved to be efficient, revealing the unbalance between the media coverage of London 2012, much more positive, and Rio 2016, more negative.},

	abstract = {Background
              The COVID-19 pandemic is severely affecting people worldwide. Currently, an important approach to understand this phenomenon and its impact on the lives of people consists of monitoring social networks and news on the internet.
            
            
              Objective
              The purpose of this study is to present a methodology to capture the main subjects and themes under discussion in news media and social media and to apply this methodology to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.
            
            
              Methods
              This work proposes a methodology based on topic modeling, namely entity recognition, and sentiment analysis of texts to compare Twitter posts and news, followed by visualization of the evolution and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We focused our analysis on Brazil, an important epicenter of the pandemic; therefore, we faced the challenge of addressing Brazilian Portuguese texts.
            
            
              Results
              In this work, we collected and analyzed 18,413 articles from news media and 1,597,934 tweets posted by 1,299,084 users in Brazil. The results show that the proposed methodology improved the topic sentiment analysis over time, enabling better monitoring of internet media. Additionally, with this tool, we extracted some interesting insights about the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. For instance, we found that Twitter presented similar topic coverage to news media; the main entities were similar, but they differed in theme distribution and entity diversity. Moreover, some aspects represented negative sentiment toward political themes in both media, and a high incidence of mentions of a specific drug denoted high political polarization during the pandemic.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This study identified the main themes under discussion in both news and social media and how their sentiments evolved over time. It is possible to understand the major concerns of the public during the pandemic, and all the obtained information is thus useful for decision-making by authorities.},

Sentiment lexicons plays an important role in sentiment analysis, where each sentiment word is given a sentiment label (positive or negative) or score (1 or -1). However, a sentiment lexicon may express different sentiment polarity according different domain. In addition, only a few studies on Portuguese sentiment analysis are reported due to the lack of resources including domain-specific sentiment lexical corpora. In this paper, we present an effective methodology, called SentiLexBR, using probabilities of the Bayes’ Theorem for building a set of sentiment lexicons. An unsupervised algorithm is proposed to automatically identify sentiment lexicons with their polarities for the Portuguese language. Experimental results on user reviews datasets in 12 different domains indicate the effectiveness of our methodology in domain-specific sentiment lexicon generation for Portuguese. In addition, the sentiment lexicon produced by SentiLexBR also significantly outperforms several alternative approaches of building domain-specific sentiment lexicons.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              This article presents two Brazilian Portuguese corpora collected from different media concerning public security issues in a specific location. The primary motivation is supporting analyses, so security authorities can make appropriate decisions about their actions.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The corpora were obtained through web scraping from a newspaper's website and tweets from a Brazilian metropolitan region. Natural language processing was applied considering: text cleaning, lemmatization, summarization, part-of-speech and dependencies parsing, named entities recognition, and topic modeling.
            
            
              Findings
              Several results were obtained based on the methodology used, highlighting some: an example of a summarization using an automated process; dependency parsing; the most common topics in each corpus; the forty named entities and the most common slogans were extracted, highlighting those linked to public security.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              Some critical tasks were identified for the research perspective, related to the applied methodology: the treatment of noise from obtaining news on their source websites, passing through textual elements quite present in social network posts such as abbreviations, emojis/emoticons, and even writing errors; the treatment of subjectivity, to eliminate noise from irony and sarcasm; the search for authentic news of issues within the target domain. All these tasks aim to improve the process to enable interested authorities to perform accurate analyses.
            
            
              Practical implications
              The corpora dedicated to the public security domain enable several analyses, such as mining public opinion on security actions in a given location; understanding criminals' behaviors reported in the news or even on social networks and drawing their attitudes timeline; detecting movements that may cause damage to public property and people welfare through texts from social networks; extracting the history and repercussions of police actions, crossing news with records on social networks; among many other possibilities.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The work on behalf of the corpora reported in this text represents one of the first initiatives to create textual bases in Portuguese, dedicated to Brazil's specific public security domain.},

Supervised classifiers (multinomial naïve Bayes, logistic regression, linear support vector machines, random forests, adaptative boosting, and multilayer perceptron) were tested, and multinomial naïve Bayes, which had the best trade-off between overfitting and correctness, was selected to classify a second set containing 221,884 unclassified tweets. A timeline with the classified tweets was constructed, helping to identify dates with peaks in each polarity and search for events that may have caused the peaks, providing methodological assistance in combating sources of misinformation linked to the spread of anti-vaccination opinion.},

First, we make available our trained BERT and Albert model for Portuguese. Second, we compare our monolingual and the standard multilingual models using experiments in semantic textual similarity, recognizing textual entailment, textual category classification, sentiment analysis, offensive comment detection, and fake news detection, to assess the effectiveness of the generated language representations. The results suggest that both monolingual and multilingual models are able to achieve state-of-the-art and the advantage of training a single language model, if any, is small.},

Bringing these three topics together to create an amazing digital customer experience and indeed deploy in production and solve real-world problems is something innovative and disruptive. We introduce a new Portuguese financial domain language representation model called BERTaú. BERTaú is an uncased BERT-base trained from scratch with data from the Itaú virtual assistant chatbot solution. Our novel contribution is that BERTaú pretrained language model requires less data, reached state-of-the-art performance in three NLP tasks, and generates a smaller and lighter model that makes the deployment feasible. We developed three tasks to validate our model: information retrieval with Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) from Itaú bank, sentiment analysis from our virtual assistant data, and a NER solution. All proposed tasks are real-world solutions in production on our environment and the usage of a specialist model proved to be effective when compared to Google BERT multilingual and the DPRQuestionEncoder from Facebook, available at Hugging Face. The BERTaú improves the performance in 22\% of FAQ Retrieval MRR metric, 2.1\% in Sentiment Analysis F1 score, 4.4\% in NER F1 score and can also represent the same sequence in up to 66\% fewer tokens when compared to "shelf models".},

We evaluated them intrinsically on syntactic and semantic analogies and extrinsically on POS tagging and sentence semantic similarity tasks. The obtained results suggest that word analogies are not appropriate for word embedding evaluation instead task-specific evaluations may be a better option; Wang2Vec appears to be a robust model; the increase in performance in our evaluations with bigger models is not worth the increase in memory usage for models with more than 300 dimensions.},

Motivated by these issues, this work analyzes the predictive performance of a range of document embedding strategies, assuming the polarity as the system outcome. This analysis includes five sentiment analysis datasets in Brazilian Portuguese, unified in a single dataset, and a reference partitioning in training, testing, and validation sets, both made publicly available through a digital repository. A cross-evaluation of dataset-specific models over different contexts is conducted to evaluate their generalization capabilities and the feasibility of adopting a unique model for addressing all scenarios.},

	abstract = {Text classification is a natural language processing (NLP) task relevant to many commercial applications, like e-commerce and customer service. Naturally, classifying such excerpts accurately often represents a challenge, due to intrinsic language aspects, like irony and nuance. To accomplish this task, one must provide a robust numerical representation for documents, a process known as embedding. Embedding represents a key NLP field nowadays, having faced a significant advance in the last decade, especially after the introduction of the word-to-vector concept and the popularization of Deep Learning models for solving NLP tasks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformer-based Language Models (TLMs). Despite the impressive achievements in this field, the literature coverage regarding generating embeddings for Brazilian Portuguese texts is scarce, especially when considering commercial user reviews. Therefore, this work aims to provide a comprehensive experimental study of embedding approaches targeting a binary sentiment classification of user reviews in Brazilian Portuguese. This study includes from classical (Bag-of-Words) to state-of-the-art (Transformer-based) NLP models. The methods are evaluated with five open-source databases with pre-defined data partitions made available in an open digital repository to encourage reproducibility. The Fine-tuned TLMs achieved the best results for all cases, being followed by the Feature-based TLM, LSTM, and CNN, with alternate ranks, depending on the database under analysis.},

            We develop a new index of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) based on newspaper coverage frequency. Several types of evidence—including human readings of 12,000 newspaper articles—indicate that our index proxies for movements in policy-related economic uncertainty. Our U.S. index spikes near tight presidential elections, Gulf Wars I and II, the 9/11 attacks, the failure of Lehman Brothers, the 2011 debt ceiling dispute, and other major battles over fiscal policy. Using firm-level data, we find that policy uncertainty is associated with greater stock price volatility and reduced investment and employment in policy-sensitive sectors like defense, health care, finance, and infrastructure construction. At the macro level, innovations in policy uncertainty foreshadow declines in investment, output, and employment in the United States and, in a panel vector autoregressive setting, for 12 major economies. Extending our U.S. index back to 1900, EPU rose dramatically in the 1930s (from late 1931) and has drifted upward since the 1960s.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty appears to jump up after major shocks like the Cuban Missile crisis, the assassination of JFK, the OPEC I oil-price shock, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. This paper offers a structural framework to analyze the impact of these uncertainty shocks. I build a model with a time-varying second moment, which is numerically solved and estimated using firm-level data. The parameterized model is then used to simulate a macro uncertainty shock, which produces a rapid drop and rebound in aggregate output and employment. This occurs because higher uncertainty causes firms to temporarily pause their investment and hiring. Productivity growth also falls because this pause in activity freezes reallocation across units. In the medium term the increased volatility from the shock induces an overshoot in output, employment, and productivity. Thus, uncertainty shocks generate short sharp recessions and recoveries. This simulated impact of an uncertainty shock is compared to vector autoregression estimations on actual data, showing a good match in both magnitude and timing. The paper also jointly estimates labor and capital adjustment costs (both convex and nonconvex). Ignoring capital adjustment costs is shown to lead to substantial bias, while ignoring labor adjustment costs does not.},

Its main contribution is recognizing that the exchange rate pass-through can vary in more or less appreciated exchange rate situations. Thereby, this paper starts from a theoretical analysis of the determinants of exchange rate pass-through, followed by an investigation of the relationship between exchange rate and inflation in Brazil. Finally, the article presents the estimates of a Vector Autoregressive model (VAR) for a Brazilian economy, between 2002 and 2021. The main results of this article indicate the exacerbated dependence of the exchange rate as a mechanism of price control in Brazil, especially in moments of exchange rate with a trend to appreciate.

	abstract = {Resumo: Muitos países, a partir da década de 1990, passaram a utilizar o Regime de Metas de Inflação (RMI) como regime de política monetária, inclusive o Brasil, que o adotou em 1999. Entretanto, há inúmeras críticas ao modo de funcionamento desse regime, além da análise das consequências de seu uso à dinâmica macroeconômica dos países. No contexto do RMI, consideram-se os desvios do produto de seu nível natural à causa do aumento generalizado dos preços, e, assim, utiliza-se a taxa de juros como instrumento de política monetária. Neste trabalho, seguindo-se uma perspectiva pós-keynesiana, que tece críticas a esse regime, inclusive ao considerar que a inflação é um fenômeno multicausado, teve-se como objetivo investigar empiricamente quais são as variáveis explicativas das causas da inflação brasileira no período pós-RMI, especificamente, de 2003 a 2016. Assim, objetiva-se, inclusive, debater se a política monetária baseada nesse regime é condizente com o funcionamento de economias monetárias. Para tanto, além da revisão bibliográfica como método de procedimento, em que se busca apresentar as diferenças teóricas do chamado Novo Consenso Macroeconômico, que dá sustentação ao RMI, e a escola pós-keynesiana, neste trabalho utiliza-se a metodologia econométrica de Vetores Autorregressivos (VARs), que permite analisar inter-relações entre múltiplas variáveis, de modo a se auferirem as variáveis relevantes na explicação da dinâmica de preços no Brasil no período recente. Os resultados encontrados apontam que os fatores do lado da oferta da economia explicam em boa medida a dinâmica inflacionária brasileira no período analisado, indicando, assim, a fragilidade em se utilizar apenas a taxa de juros como instrumento de política monetária.Palavras-chave: Regime de Metas de Inflação. Pós-keynesianos. Inflação. Inflation dynamics and monetary policy in Brazil: a post-keynesian reading using the Self-Regressive Vector (VAR) Abstract: Many countries started to use the Inflation Target Regime (RMI) as a monetary policy regime, including Brazil, which adopted it in 1999. However, there are innumerable criticisms of the way this regime operates, besides the analysis of the consequences of its use to the macroeconomic dynamics of the countries. In the context of the RMI, the deviations of the product from its natural level are taken as the cause of the generalized increase of prices, and thus, the interest rate is used as a monetary policy instrument. This work, following a post-keynesian perspective, which criticizes this regime, including considering that inflation is a multi-caused phenomenon, aims to investigate empirically what are the explanatory variables of the causes of brazilian inflation in the post-RMI period, specifically from 2003 to 2016. Thus, it is also intended to discuss whether the monetary policy based on this regime is consistent with the operation of monetary economies. For this, in addition to the bibliographic review as a procedure method, which seeks to present the theoretical differences of the so-called New Macroeconomic Consensus, which gives support to the RMI, and the post-keynesian school, this work uses the econometric methodology of Autoregressive Vectors (VAR), which allows analyzing interrelations between multiple variables, in order to obtain the relevant variables in the explanation of the price dynamics in Brazil in the recent period. The results show that the factors on the supply side of the economy largely explain the brazilian inflationary dynamics in the period analyzed, thus indicating the fragility of using only the interest rate as a monetary policy instrument.Keywords: Inflation Target Regime.

	abstract = {The dynamic causal effect of an intervention on an outcome is of paramount interest to applied macro- and micro-economics research. However, this question has been generally approached differently by the two literatures. In making the transition from traditional time series methods to applied microeconometrics, local projections can serve as a natural bridge. Local projections can translate the familiar language of vector autoregressions (VARs) and impulse responses into the language of potential outcomes and treatment effects. There are gains to be made by both literatures from greater integration of well established methods in each. This review shows how to make these connections and points to potential areas of further research.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces methods to compute impulse responses without specification and estimation of the underlying multivariate dynamic system. The central idea consists in estimating local projections at each period of interest rather than extrapolating into increasingly distant horizons from a given model, as it is done with vector autoregressions (VAR). The advantages of local projections are numerous: (1) they can be estimated by simple regression techniques with standard regression packages; (2) they are more robust to misspecification; (3) joint or point-wise analytic inference is simple; and (4) they easily accommodate experimentation with highly nonlinear and flexible specifications that may be impractical in a multivariate context. Therefore, these methods are a natural alternative to estimating impulse responses from VARs. Monte Carlo evidence and an application to a simple, closed-economy, new-Keynesian model clarify these numerous advantages.},

	abstract = {We consider impulse response inference in a locally misspecified stationary vector autoregression (VAR) model. The conventional local projection (LP) confidence interval has correct coverage even when the misspecification is so large that it can be detected with probability approaching 1. This follows from a “double robustness” property analogous to that of modern estimators for partially linear regressions. In contrast, VAR confidence intervals dramatically undercover even for misspecification so small that it is difficult to detect statistically and cannot be ruled out based on economic theory. This is because of a “no free lunch” result for VARs: the worst-case bias and coverage distortion are small if, and only if, the variance is close to that of LP. While VAR coverage can be restored by using a bias-aware critical value or a large lag length, the resulting confidence interval tends to be at least as wide as the LP interval.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.},

We compare the predictive accuracy of a large set of sentiment analysis models using a sample of articles that have been rated by humans on a positivity/negativity scale. The results highlight the gains from combining existing lexicons and from accounting for negation. We also generate our own sentiment-scoring model, which includes a new lexicon built specifically to capture the sentiment in economic news articles. This model is shown to have better predictive accuracy than existing, “off-the-shelf”, models. Lastly, we provide two applications to the economic research on sentiment. First, we show that daily news sentiment is predictive of movements of survey-based measures of consumer sentiment. Second, motivated by Barsky and Sims (2012), we estimate the impulse responses of macroeconomic variables to sentiment shocks, finding that positive sentiment shocks increase consumption, output, and interest rates and dampen inflation.},

It focuses not only on Keynes' ideas on expectation formation but also on the degree of confidence attached to those expectations (i.e., uncertainty) and what this means for macroeconomic theory. After providing a synthetic account of Keynes' ideas on knowledge and expectations, along with his understanding of the source of uncertainty, the chapter considers his emphasis on the role of conventional judgment, and of conventions more generally, as well as the implications of these ideas for how we may understand and use the concept of rationality in a Keynesian framework, alongside considerations of logic and consistency. Keynes' concern with the interplay between individuality and sociality sheds some light on Keynes in relation to the formulation of microfoundations. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the implications of Keynes' ideas on knowledge, expectations, and rationality for economic methodology.},

	abstract = {Twitter sentiment analysis has been employed as a prognostic tool for predicting prices and trends in both stock and housing markets. Early studies in this domain drew inspiration from behavioural economics, establishing a link between sentiments or emotions and economic decision-making. However, recent investigations in this field have shifted their focus from the data utilized to the algorithms employed. A comprehensive literature review, with an emphasis on the data aspect, reveals a scarcity of research considering the influence of sentiments arising from external factors on stock or housing markets, despite abundant evidence in behavioural economics suggesting that sentiments induced by external factors impact economic decisions. To bridge this gap, this study explores the impact of Twitter sentiment related to the Covid-19 pandemic on housing prices in Singapore. Employing SNSCRAPE for tweet collection, sentiment analysis is conducted using VADER. Granger Causality is applied to investigate the relationship between Covid-19 cases and sentiment, while neural networks serve as prediction models. The research compares the predictive capacity of Twitter sentiment regarding Covid-19 with traditional housing price predictors, such as structural and neighbourhood characteristics. Findings indicate that utilizing Twitter sentiment related to Covid-19 yields superior predictions compared to relying solely on traditional predictors, outperforming two specific traditional predictors. Consequently, this study underscores the significance of considering Twitter sentiment related to external factors as crucial in economic predictions, demonstrating practical applications of sentiment analysis on Twitter data in real-world economic scenarios.},

	abstract = {In this article, Christopher A. Sims argues the answer to his title is yes. Sims explains that any decisionmaking model must incorporate some identifying assumptions to enable it to forecast the effects of alternative decisions. He argues that although all identifying assumptions in econometric policymaking models are of uncertain validity, those incorporated in vector autoregression (VAR) forecasting models have the advantage of allowing their uncertainty to be measured. Sims concludes by demonstrating a method for identifying a small macroeconomic VAR model so that it can be used to analyze monetary policy},

	abstract = {Using quarterly data from 1968 to 1988, we analyze the time series properties of the various attack modes used by transnational terrorists. Combining vector autoregression and intervention analysis, we find strong evidence of both substitutes and complements among the attack modes. We also evaluate the effectiveness of six policies designed to thwart terrorism. The existence of complements and substitutes means that policies designed to reduce one type of attack may affect other attack modes. For example, the installation of metal detectors in airports reduced skyjackings and diplomatic incidents but increased other kinds of hostage attacks (barricade missions, kidnappings) and assassinations. In the long run, embassy fortification decreased barricade missions but increased assassinations. The Reagan “get tough” policy, which resulted in the enactment of two laws in 1984 and a retaliatory raid on Libya in 1986, did not have any noticeable long-term effect on curbing terrorist attacks directed against U.S. interests.},
